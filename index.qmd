Hello! Welcome to my blog! 👋

I’m originally from Salvador, Brazil, but I lived in the Middle East for six years and in the US since 2020.

For the past few years, I've been helping build data analysis and visualization tools. Currently, I'm working on Positron, an open-source data science IDE.

My personal projects revolve around the idea that we can (and should) use data science for social good, aiming to understand and improve the world.

Herein, I share some ideas and projects related to data science, tech, and social good.
